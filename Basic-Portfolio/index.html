        <p1>Alexander Besancon is an accomplished and experienced military logistics leader 
        with a Bachelors of History from Texas A&M University. During his time in the 
        military he was able to build a cohesive team based on trust and mutual respect. 
        This resulted in in his team reaching their organizations objectives in many places
        in the United States and Kuwait. His belief in building a team based on trust and
        mutual respect enabled his team to mobilize a 65 vehicle convoy to support Hurricane 
        Harvey relief efforts from Fort Riley, Kansas in six days.
